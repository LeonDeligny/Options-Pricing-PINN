# Options-Pricing-PINN

## Overview
This project implements Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE) for option pricing. PINNs integrate data with physical laws, providing a mesh-free approach to solving PDEs, which is particularly beneficial in financial engineering applications.

## Features
- **Black-Scholes Equation Solver**: Uses PINNs to model and solve the Black-Scholes PDE for option pricing.
- **Mesh-Free Method**: Utilizes a meshless approach, enhancing flexibility and efficiency in solving PDEs.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easily adaptable for other financial models and PDEs.
